<p>Artemisinin is the new drug on the scene. Although it was discovered years ago, it has only been mass produced to fight malaria more recently. <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria has evolved resistance to every other drug that has been used against it, and now it appears that the same is the case for Artemisinin.</p>

<p>Understanding where and when this resistance has evolved is crucial to the future management of this most effective anti-malarial drug. We use the <b>Malaria Observatory data</b> to investigate how many times resistance to artemisinin has evolved.</p>
