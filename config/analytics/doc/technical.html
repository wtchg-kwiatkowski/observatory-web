                <Typography component="p"> Currently, all samples have been collected by collaborators from the <a href="https://www.malariagen.net/"> MalariaGEN</a> network from across the world. The majority of samples will have been taken as blood draws from people with malaria, from which DNA will have been extracted. It is now also possible to extract DNA from dried blood spots collected on filter paper.
                </Typography>
                <Typography component="p"> In the near future, we'll be able to incorporate any available DNA sequence data into the datasets underlying MalariaGEN Analytics. Our vision is that researchers should be able to compare brand new sequences to our database to understand where new infections have come from and what drugs they're resistant to.

                <Typography component="p">
                  We use two technologies to generate genomic data. Wherever possible (depending on having enough DNA) we use whole-genome sequencing technology to read every base in the parasites genome. For samples sequenced at the <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/"> Wellcome Sanger Institute</a> we use Illumina HiSeq sequencing machines to do this.
                </Typography>
                <Typography type="p">For samples with low quantity of DNA we concentrate on genotyping roughly 100 informative genetic markers using the Agena platform.
                </Typography>
                <Typography component="p"> We then combine all available sequence data into a large united dataset on which we then run our analytics.

                <Typography component="p"> Our genome analytics are metrics that we generate through the analysis of MalariaGEN Observatory datasets. You can find a more technical description of how we do this here.
