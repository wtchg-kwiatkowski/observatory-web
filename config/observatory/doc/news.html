<p>Artemisinin is the new drug on the scene. Although it was discovered years ago, it has only been mass produced to fight malaria more recently. <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria has evolved resistance to every other drug that has been used against it, and now it appears that the same is the case for Artemisinin.</p>

<p>Understanding where and when this resistance has evolved is crucial to the future management of this most effective anti-malarial drug. We use the <b>Malaria Observatory data</b> to investigate how many times resistance to artemisinin has evolved.</p>

<p>The ability to quickly test and diagnose malaria in the field is crucial. Control programs neither want to waste precious drugs on people who aren't infected nor use drugs when there's no need. Thereforen rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are an important component of malaria control.</p>

<p>However, recent research has uncovered a worrying issue. A genomic deletion in the XXX gene of the <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> malaria genome causes the most common RDT to fail. We use the <b>Malaria Observatory data</b> to epxlore the distribution of the deletion and investigate the extent to which this mutation has the ability to hamper future eradication efforts.</p>
