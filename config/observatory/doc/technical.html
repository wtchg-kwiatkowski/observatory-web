                    Currently, all samples have been collected by collaborators from the <a href="https://www.malariagen.net/"> MalariaGEN</a> network from across the world. The majority of samples will have been taken as blood draws from people with malaria, from which DNA will have been extracted. It is now also possible to extract DNA from dried blood spots collected on filter paper.

                    In the near future, we'll be able to incorporate any available DNA sequence data into the datasets underlying Malariometrics. Our vision is that researchers should be able to compare brand new sequences to our database to understand where new infections have come from and what drugs they're resistant to.

                   Wherever possible (depending on having enough DNA) we have use whole-genome sequencing technology to read every base in the parasites genome. For samples sequenced at the Sanger Institute we use Illumina HiSeq sequencing machines to do this.

                  For samples with low quantity of DNA we concentrate on genotyping roughly 100 informative genetic markers.

                We then combine all available sequence data into a large united dataset on which we then run our analytics.

                  Put simply, our genome analytics are metrics that we generate through the analysis of MalariaGEN Observatory datasets. You can find a more technical description of how we do this here.
