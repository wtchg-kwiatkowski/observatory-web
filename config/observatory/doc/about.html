                    Malariometric indices traditionally include measurements like prevalence of malaria parasitaemia, spleen rate, and anaemia in defined risk groups. The purpose of this webapp is to provide measurements on parasites based on their genomes. For each individual parasite we will generate a number of different metrics, from presence/absence of particular alleles through to haplogroup assignation. Malariometrics presents these metrics in an intuitive and informative way by aggregating information across sites, countries, and regions.
