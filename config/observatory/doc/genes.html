                         Differentiation is a measure of how varied allele frequencies are across populations. Such variation can be the result of natural selection working on specific populations to increase or decrease the frequency of a specific allele, so differentiation is a useful metric for identifying genes that are evolving.

Interestingly, globally differentiated genes tend to be involved in parasite/vector interactions, whereas differentiation within populations in a region often involves known drug resistance genes.<br/>
