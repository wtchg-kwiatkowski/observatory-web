                  Differentiation is a measure of how varied allele frequencies are across populations. Such variation can be the result of natural selection working on specific populations to increase or decrease the frequency of a specific allele, so differentiation is a useful metric for identifying genes that are evolving.

                  <Typography component="div" className="paragraph"> Each row represents a gene in the <em>P. faliciparum</em> genome. We have computed two differentiation statistics for each gene indicating how much variation there is across parasites either <strong>globally</strong> or <strong>locally</strong>.

                  <Typography component="div" className="paragraph">
                  Because natural selection at a gene causes nearby unselected to genes to appear differentiated, we have also estimated the <strong>Distance to higher local score</strong>.

                  <Typography component="div" className="paragraph">Globally differentiated genes tend to be involved in parasite/vector interactions, whereas differentiation within populations in a region often involves known drug resistance genes.
