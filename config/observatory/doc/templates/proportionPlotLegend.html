Lighter coloured bars represent predictions based on low numbers of parasites (fewer than 200) indicating lower confidence proportion estimates. Total counts (shown on the right) may be different across rows from the same site, region or drug, because we are less able to predict resistance when genotyping quality is low, and this varies across the genomes of individual parasites.
