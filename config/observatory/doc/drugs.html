                    How does anti-malarial drug resistance occur?

                    Resistance is a result of evolution
                </Typography>
                <Typography component="h4">Humans have been getting malaria for thousands of years.</Typography>

                <Typography component="p">People get malaria when they are bitten by an infected mosquito. After this transmission from mosquito to human host, the parasite travels to and infects liver cells, at which point the population of parasites within a host begins to quickly grow. This explosive growth is the result of many rounds of exponential multiplication. For this multiplication to work, the parasites need to copy the whole of their genome, and as each parasite does this, one or two mistakes, known as mutations, can creep in.</Typography>

                <Typography component="p">The generation of so many new parasites creates novel genetic diversity. And although the mutations underlying this diversity are normally benign or even detrimental to the parasite, very occasionally a mutation can give a parasite an advantage. </Typography>

                <Typography component="h4">New genetic diversity makes the evolution of drug resistance possible</Typography>

                <Typography component="p">It is this churn in new genetic diversity that goes some way to explaining how drug resistance evolves. Millions of random mutations are generated over the course of an infection, and given that hundreds of millions of people are infected with malaria every year, sooner or later one that gives a parasite resistance to the drug being used will occur.</Typography>

                <Typography component="p">Unlike other parasites in an infection, a parasite with a resistance mutation will be left unaffected by a drug, and rather than dying will continue to circulate around the human host.</Typography>

                <Typography component="p">If a parasite that has evolved resistance, or more likely its offspring, are present in the bloodstream when the infected host next gets bitten, then the drug resistant parasite has the potential to move between people and resistance can spread.</Typography>

                <Typography component="h4">Linking a parasite's DNA to drug resistance with genetic markers</Typography>

                <Typography component="p">The best way to test whether a parasite is resistant to a drug is to challenge them with the drug and see how it responds. One common way of doing this is to administer a drug and then count the number of parasites in the blood stream measured every hour afterwards to see how long the drug takes to clear the parasite from the blood stream. Whilst this allows us to identify resistance in the first place, because it is time intensive and requires lab resources, it is impractical to do on a large-scale basis. However, what we can do is use information on the genetics of parasites which are known to be resistant to predict resistance in parasites for which we only have genetic informations. </Typography>
